Hi. I'm Guodong Jin.

I'm a PhD candidate at [RUC](http://www.ruc.edu.cn/en) in China. My research interests focus on optimizing big data management and analytical systems.

I'm happiest working with Java :smile. And I can code in Golang, Scala and C. I enjoy playing with different programming languages to find interesting features behind.

Except for coding, I read a lot. And I'd like to share some of my thoughts here in my blog.

Besides, I like playing video games. [RimWorld][rim] and [Civilization][civ] are my favourites.

I'm always learning and improving my craft skills: well designed interface, clean and readable code, good documentation.
