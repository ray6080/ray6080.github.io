Hi. I'm Guodong Jin. I'm a co-founder of Kùzu Inc. I work on [Kùzu](https://kuzudb.com), which is an in-process graph database management system (GDBMS) built for query speed and scalability. It is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/kuzudb/kuzu).

Previously, I was a Post-doctoral Fellow working with [Prof. Semih Salihoglu](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~ssalihog) at the [Data Systems Group (DSG)](https://dsg.uwaterloo.ca), University of Waterloo.

You can find out more about me [here](https://www.guodongjin.com/about).
