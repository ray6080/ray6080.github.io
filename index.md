Hi. I'm Guodong Jin. I work on [KÃ¹zu](https://kuzudb.com), which is an in-process property graph database management system (GDBMS) built for query speed and scalability at the University of Waterloo.

Besides, I am a Post-doctoral Fellow working with [Prof. Semih Salihoglu](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~ssalihog) at the [Data Systems Group (DSG)](https://dsg.uwaterloo.ca), University of Waterloo.

You can find out more about me [here](https://www.guodongjin.com/about).
