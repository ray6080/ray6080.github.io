Caffe is a framework for convolutional deep learning algorithms, developed and maintained by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center.

Convolutional neural networks grew to prominence as Alex Krizhevsky used them to win year 2012's ImageNet competition, dropping the classfication error from 266% to 15%. ConvNet is a kind of Neural Network architecture, while making the explicit assumption that the inputs are images.
