NewSQL has become the new sexy in the DBMS area. Many startups tout their products as NewSQL databases.
However, is NewSQL really new? How does NewSQL come about and what does the term mean?
I will share some facts and thoughts below.

This article is mostly inspired by the great article "What's Really New with NewSQL?" (by Andrew Pavlo and Matthew Aslett, SIGMOD Record, June 2016).

### A Little About The History

The first DBMSs came out in the mid-1960s, e.g., IBM's IMS.
It separates an application's code from data that it operates on, and frees developers to write applications without concerns about data manipulation performance.
IMS was later followed by the pioneering work in the early 1970s on the first relational DBMSs, IBM's System R and INGRES from the University of California.
The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the rise and fall of object-oriented DBMSs, many of whose ideas are incorporated into document-oriented NoSQL systems over two decades later.
Moreover, two all-star open source databases, MySQL and PostgreSQL, starts during the 1990s.

Radical changes took place with the arrival of the 2000s.
Internet applications sprouted around the world, and scalability is the new dimension.
Systems need to scale to support massive concurrent users and provide online services with high availability.
Thus, custom middlewares are developed to shard single-node DBMSs over a cluster of less expensive machines.
With the help of such middlewares, the system presents a single logical database to users, while data and queries are stored and executed in the whole cluster.
Two notable examples are eBay's Oracle-based cluster[1] and Google's MySQL-based cluster[2].

Early sharding middlewares faced challenges when it comes to joining tables or updating more than one record in a transaction.
At that time, many companies, especially internet companies, re-thought their needs for consistency and correctness at the expense of availability and performance.
Many of them turn their focus away from traditional DBMSs and develop their own database systems.
Likewise, the relational model is also under heated debates whether it is the best way to represent an application's data.
Further, many thought that using SQL may also be overkill for simple lookup queries.

These rethinks add impetus to the NoSQL movement in the mid of late 2000s[3].
The key to this movement is to develop new database systems that forgo strong transactional guarantees and the relational model of traditional DBMSs.
Eventual consistency and K-V/Graph/Document models become the new standard equipment.
The two well-known pioneering systems are Google's BigTable and Amazon's Dynamo.
Based on them, many similar systems, including Facebook's Cassandra (based on BigTable and Dynamo) and PowerSet's HBase (based on BigTable), were born to follow the fashion.
Besides, among startups, the most well-known one is MongoDB.

NoSQL led the fashion, and at the same time created more chaos.
By the end of the 2000s, many applications found themselves at awkward situations that they cannot give up strong transactional and consistency requirements as they thought.
Also, it was painful for developers to spend too much energy writing code to handle inconsistent data.
Thus, it is in this environment that brought about **NewSQL** systems, which aims to provide the same scalable performance of NoSQL for OLTP read-write workloads while still maintaining ACID guarantees for transactions.
