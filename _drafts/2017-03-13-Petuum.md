Many platforms have prodivded partial solutions to bridge this research-to-production gap: while Hadoop is a popular and easy to program platform, the simplicity of its MapReduce abstraction makes it difficult to exploit ML properties such as error tolerance and its performance on many ML performances has been surpassed by alternatives.

ML algorithms all bears a common style, in that they resort to an iterative-convergent procedure. It is noteworthy that iterative-convergent computing tasks are vastly different from conventional programmatic computing tasks.
