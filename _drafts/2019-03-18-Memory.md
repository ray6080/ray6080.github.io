Do you really know your memory?
I don't, honestly.

Questions:
1. What happened when I read a file from my disk?
2. What happened when I claim a segment of memory using `malloc()`?
3. Why is sometimes memory accessing so slow?
4. Why do they always say memory is virtual (I can touch the DRAM chips physically)?
5. Wow, my process claims much more memory than my actual memory limits, how come?
